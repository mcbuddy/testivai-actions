# Progress: TestivAI Visual Regression Approval GitHub Action

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Final Implementation

We have completed the implementation phase and are now in the final stages of the project. All core functionality has been implemented, comprehensive tests have been created and are passing with high code coverage, and the action has been bundled for distribution. We are now ready to finalize documentation, prepare for release, and conduct integration testing in a real environment.

## What Works

The following components have been implemented and tested:

- âœ… Project requirements defined
- âœ… System architecture designed
- âœ… Technical approach determined
- âœ… Memory bank initialized
- âœ… Project structure set up
- âœ… Package dependencies defined
- âœ… Action metadata configured
- âœ… Example workflow created
- âœ… Core modules implemented:
  - âœ… Comment parser
  - âœ… Approvals manager
  - âœ… Git operations
  - âœ… TestivAI CLI wrapper
- âœ… Test framework established with comprehensive test cases
- âœ… All tests passing with high code coverage
- âœ… Code quality tools configured (ESLint, Prettier)
- âœ… Action bundled for distribution

## What's Left to Build

While the core implementation is complete, there are still a few tasks remaining:

### 1. Documentation Enhancements
- [x] Add more detailed examples to README
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide
- [x] Add visual guides for the approval process
- [x] Document edge cases and limitations

### 2. Release Preparation
- [x] Create release script
- [x] Prepare release notes template
- [x] Set up GitHub issue and PR templates
- [x] Create community guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [x] Create GitHub release script
- [x] Create usage monitoring script
- [x] Create maintenance script
- [ ] Create release tags
- [ ] Publish to GitHub Marketplace

### 3. Integration Testing in Real Environment
- [x] Create integration testing guide
- [x] Create test script for real repository testing
- [ ] Test the action in a real GitHub repository
- [ ] Verify functionality with actual PR comments
- [ ] Gather feedback from users

## Implementation Timeline

| Project Setup | Day 1 | Completed âœ… |
| Comment Parser | Day 2 | Completed âœ… |
| Approvals Manager | Day 3 | Completed âœ… |
| TestivAI Integration | Day 4 | Completed âœ… |
| Git Operations | Day 5 | Completed âœ… |
| Testing | Day 6-7 | Completed âœ… |
| Documentation | Day 8 | Partially Complete ðŸ”„ |
| Final Review | Day 9 | In Progress ðŸ”„ |

## Known Issues

As implementation hasn't started, there are no known issues with the code. However, we have identified potential challenges:

1. **GitHub Token Permissions**: May need to ensure the token has sufficient permissions for pushing to PR branches
2. **TestivAI CLI Compatibility**: Need to verify compatibility with different versions of TestivAI
3. **PR Comment Triggers**: Need to handle potential race conditions with multiple comments
4. **Error Recovery**: Need to implement robust error handling for various failure scenarios

## Evolution of Project Decisions

As this is the initial setup, we haven't yet had to revise any decisions. The following decisions have been made:

1. **Implementation Language**: JavaScript/Node.js
   - Rationale: Native support in GitHub Actions, strong ecosystem

2. **Command Format**: Slash commands (`/approve-visuals`, `/reject-visuals`)
   - Rationale: Familiar pattern for GitHub users, clear intent

3. **Architecture**: Modular with clear separation of concerns
   - Rationale: Maintainability, testability, and extensibility

4. **Approval Storage**: JSON format
   - Rationale: Compatible with TestivAI, easy to manipulate in JavaScript

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Create a release tag using the release script
2. Test the action in a real GitHub repository
3. Gather feedback and make final adjustments
4. Publish to GitHub Marketplace
5. Monitor adoption and gather user feedback

## Blockers and Dependencies

No active blockers at this time. The project can proceed with implementation based on the defined requirements and architecture.
