# Active Context: TestivAI Visual Regression Approval GitHub Action

## Current Work Focus

We are in the final phase of creating a GitHub Action that will enable developers to approve or reject visual regression changes generated by TestivAI directly through PR comments. The action will:

1. Listen for specific comment formats in PRs
2. Process these comments to determine approval/rejection intent
3. Update the necessary files to reflect these decisions
4. Commit changes back to the PR branch

Our immediate focus is on finalizing the implementation and preparing for distribution. We have successfully implemented all core functionality, created comprehensive tests, and bundled the action for distribution.

   - Create GitHub release using the release script (`node scripts/create-github-release.js v1.0.0 <token>`)
   - Publish to GitHub Marketplace
   - Announce the release

2. **Integration Testing in Real Environment**:
   - Follow the integration testing guide
   - Test the action in a real GitHub repository
   - Verify functionality with actual PR comments
   - Gather feedback from users

3. **Final Refinements**:
   - Address any issues found during testing
   - Make final adjustments based on feedback
   - Prepare for wider adoption

3. **Workflow Integration**:
   - Create example workflow file
   - Test the action in a real GitHub environment
   - Verify proper handling of different comment formats

4. **Documentation**:
   - Write comprehensive README with usage instructions
   - Document the action's inputs and outputs
   - Provide example workflow configurations
   - Create visual guides for the approval process

5. **Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for all modules
   - Create integration tests for the complete workflow
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Implementation Language**: 
   - Decision: Using JavaScript/Node.js for the action
   - Rationale: Native support in GitHub Actions, strong ecosystem for GitHub API integration, and excellent JSON handling capabilities

2. **Command Format**:
   - Decision: Using slash commands (`/approve-visuals`, `/reject-visuals`)
   - Rationale: Familiar pattern for GitHub users, clear intent, easy to parse

3. **Approval Storage**:
   - Decision: Using JSON for storing approvals
   - Rationale: Compatible with TestivAI, easy to manipulate in JavaScript, human-readable

4. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Decision: Fail gracefully with informative messages
   - Consideration: Need to balance between stopping on critical errors and attempting to continue with partial success

5. **Authentication Approach**:
   - Decision: Using GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication
   - Consideration: Need to ensure the token has sufficient permissions for the required operations

6. **TestivAI Integration**:
   - Decision: Using the TestivAI CLI for baseline updates
   - Consideration: Need to ensure compatibility with different TestivAI versions

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
   - Each module focused on a specific responsibility
   - Clean interfaces between components

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error catching and reporting
   - Informative error messages for users
   - Graceful degradation when possible

3. **Testing**:
   - Test-driven development approach
   - High test coverage for critical paths
   - Mocking external dependencies for reliable tests

4. **Documentation**:
   - Inline code documentation for developers
   - User-focused README with clear examples
   - Visual guides where appropriate

5. **Security**:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Minimal required permissions
   - Secure handling of tokens and credentials

## Learnings and Project Insights

As we're just starting the project, we don't have specific learnings to report yet. However, we anticipate gaining insights into:

1. GitHub Actions development best practices
2. Effective integration with TestivAI's visual regression system
3. Optimizing the developer experience for visual approval workflows
4. Balancing automation with human decision-making in visual testing

## Current Questions and Uncertainties

1. âœ… What is the exact format of TestivAI's approvals.json file? - Resolved
   - The format has been identified as having separate arrays for "approved", "rejected", "new", and "deleted" images
   - The "meta" section contains fields like "author", "timestamp", "source", "pr_url", "commit_sha", and "commit_url"
   - Implementation has been updated to match this format

2. Are there any rate limits or performance considerations for the TestivAI CLI?
3. How should we handle conflicts if multiple approvals/rejections occur in quick succession?
4. What level of feedback should be provided to users after processing comments?
5. How should we handle approvals for images that no longer exist?

Most of these questions will be addressed as we progress with the implementation and gain more experience with the TestivAI system.
